### :dart: About ##

A Slack bot which takes the food order for the day. As many of us use Slack on a daily basis for work, school, or personal use, we want to use Slack to help us automate the process to track employee food purchases and  manage balances.


There aren't a lot of steps to set-up a meal allowance; we can break it down into two steps.
- Step 1: Determine how much you want to offer your people and within what timeframe.
  - #### Examples below referenced from [compt.io](https://www.compt.io/meal-allowance-food-stipend-guide#examples)
  - > MasterClass offers their employees $120/month as an interim snack stipend
  - > Snapchat gives its people $16/day for food. 

- Step 2: Decide how the program will be managed.
